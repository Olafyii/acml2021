title: Call for Tutorials
---

We invite proposals for tutorials on machine learning and related areas, to be given online as a part of ACML 2021 on November 17, 2021. A tutorial should be of interest to a wide ACML audience, provides a basic introduction to the area including its theoretical and practical implications, and covers recent advances on the chosen subject. Presentations that focus exclusively on the presenter's own work or commercial demonstrations are strongly discouraged. Each tutorial is approximately 2.5 hours, including time for breaks.

A proposal should not exceed two pages, excluding the presenters' biographies. Please include the following information in the proposal:

* A title and an abstract suitable for web publicity.
* An overview of the topic, including its relevance and significance to the machine learning community.
* Pointers to relevant past work, tutorials, and existing teaching materials.
* Target audience.
* An outline of the tutorial structure, with time allocation and distribution of work (in the case of multiple presenters).
* An academic bio for each presenter.

Proposals and questions should be submitted to tutorial co-chairs Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen <yvchen@csie.ntu.edu.tw> and Dani Yogatama: <dyogatama@deepmind.com>.
